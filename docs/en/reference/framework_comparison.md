# Training vs Inference Frameworks

This page answers a practical question:

- What does a training framework do?
- What does an inference framework do?
- Which layer does this from-scratch C++ inference tutorial study?

## Engine Layer

The engine layer is the execution core of inference systems. It turns a static model into a runnable runtime with clear boundaries for:

- tensor representation
- weight loading
- operator execution
- decoder structure
- runtime state and KV cache
- quantization and backend adaptation
- testing and benchmarking

You can think of Python inference frameworks as the "control tower" and the C++ inference engine as the "engine":

- the control tower organizes requests and workflows
- the engine executes the hot path, manages memory and state, and determines latency and throughput

This tutorial teaches both sides together, but the main line focuses on the engine layer first.

## 1. One-sentence distinction

- **Training framework**: builds the model
- **Inference framework**: runs the model, keeps it fast, and keeps it stable
- **This tutorial**: breaks down the main inference ideas and builds a minimal implementation that can be studied, verified, and extended

## 1.1 Where each framework sits

Training frameworks, inference frameworks, and this tutorial play different roles in the system.

| Object | System role | Structure | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Training framework | Upstream production system | model definition, autograd, optimizer, training loop, distributed execution, checkpointing | trained weights, training logs, optimizer state |
| Inference framework | Runtime service system | request entry, scheduling, cache, streaming, backend, deployment interface | deployable runtime / engine / endpoint |
| This tutorial | Teaching and understanding middle layer | `Tensor`, loader, operator, decoder, runtime, quantization, benchmark | a readable, runnable, editable, verifiable inference path |

The point of this comparison is simple:

- training frameworks focus on "building the model"
- inference frameworks focus on "serving the model"
- this tutorial focuses on "making the middle layer understandable"

So these are not competing products on the same layer. They are different stops on the same pipeline:

1. the training framework produces the model
2. this tutorial explains the key ideas from model to runtime
3. the inference framework turns runtime into a service

## 2. Main differences

| Dimension | Training framework | Inference framework | This tutorial |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Train a usable model | Serve inference with low latency and high throughput | Build a verifiable, explainable inference path from scratch |
| Core tasks | Forward, backward, gradients, optimizer, distributed training | Forward-only, scheduling, KV cache, quantization, streaming | Tensor, loader, operators, decoder, generation, benchmark |
| Main focus | Training stability, differentiability, throughput, memory efficiency | Throughput, latency, concurrency, caching, deployment | Principles, boundaries, implementation, verification, migration |
| Typical objects | PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow | `llama.cpp`, `vLLM`, `SGLang`, `TensorRT-LLM` | This repository’s chapter line |
| Output | checkpoint, optimizer state, logs | runtime / engine / serving endpoint | A readable, runnable, editable teaching implementation |

## 3. Training framework traits

Training frameworks care about learning the model.

They usually provide:

- automatic differentiation and backpropagation
- optimizers and learning-rate schedules
- eager or graph-style training execution
- mixed precision training
- distributed training and communication
- checkpoint save and restore

Their strength is flexibility.  
They are not built to minimize single-token latency.

## 4. Inference framework traits

Inference frameworks care about running the trained model efficiently.

They usually emphasize:

- forward-only execution
- KV cache management
- batching and scheduling
- streaming output
- quantization and deployment
- balancing throughput, latency, and resource use

## 5. This tutorial is in the middle layer

This tutorial is neither a training framework nor a production inference system.  
It is a learning path that separates the main ideas and then builds a minimal runtime.

It keeps:

- `Tensor` object modeling
- weight loading
- view semantics and shared storage
- operator boundaries
- generation runtime
- quantization path
- benchmark and verification discipline

It does not focus on:

- full training graphs
- backward propagation
- large-scale distributed training
- production multi-tenant serving
- complex scheduling or fault tolerance

## 6. The chain of responsibility

1. **Training framework**
   - trains the model
   - produces weights and training artifacts
2. **This tutorial**
   - starts from weights
   - organizes tensor, operator, decoder, and runtime layers
   - explains the key ideas in inference
3. **Inference framework**
   - turns inference into a deployable, scalable, schedulable service

## 7. What this tutorial borrows

### 7.1 From training frameworks

- unified object representation
- tensor and shape thinking
- model structure layering
- verification-oriented engineering discipline

### 7.2 From inference frameworks

- forward-only execution
- KV cache and request state
- scheduler, batching, and streaming
- quantization and deployment constraints

### 7.3 This tutorial’s own trade-off

We compress those ideas into a more teachable path:

- understand `Tensor`
- understand loader and view
- understand `MatMul` and attention
- understand generation runtime
- understand quantization
- finish with benchmark and verification

## 8. Concrete examples

### Training framework examples

- `PyTorch`
  - the most common training reference
  - useful for tensor, autograd, module, optimizer, and training-loop concepts
- `JAX`
  - useful for functional style and transformation thinking
- `TensorFlow`
  - useful for graph execution and deployment layering
- `DeepSpeed`
  - useful for large-model training systems

### Inference framework examples

- `llama.cpp`
  - local inference baseline
- `gemma.cpp`
  - a more specific and shorter C++ example
- `vLLM`
  - high-throughput serving
- `SGLang`
  - structured serving and orchestration
- `TensorRT-LLM`
  - GPU engine and deployment

### Model-family example

- `Gemma`
  - not a training framework and not an inference framework
  - it is the object being inferred

## 9. How to use this page

- Read it first if you want to understand why training and inference look different
- Use it to locate which layer the tutorial is actually teaching
- Treat it as a map, not as a replacement for the main line

If you want the shortest route map, start from [guide.md](/en/guide) or [README.md](/en/README), then come back here when you need the engine-layer map.
